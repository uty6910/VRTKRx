# VRTKRx
VRTK Rx is a library that allows VRTK to be handled as Observable of UniRx. We define VRTK's Controller events as ObservableTrigger
## Requirements
- [UniRx 5.5.0+](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx)
## Installation
Since VRTK and UniRx are not included, they need to be imported by themselves.
